### a pomodoro timer for hackathons


## what is a pomodoro timer?
a pomodoro timer is a timer that is made to follow the pomodoro method, which is as follows:
1. 25 minutes of work
2. 5 minutes of break
3. repeat steps 1 & 2 three more times
4. 30 minutes of break
it's called the pomodoro method because the person who invented it used a kitchen timer shaped like a tomato

(pomodoro is italian for tomato)

## why did i make one?
so i do a lot of hackathons, and i usually go with the same 3 other people. one of these people will only code for a very short period of time. they will then go on an extremely long break to play brawl stars, while their other group members are working. they will then repeat this process.

as you might be able to guess, this is pretty annoying. i decided to make them a pomodoro timer that they could use, because it was made by someone they know so maybe they'd appreciate it and use it. it's definitely a big maybe, but i believe :)

## what if i don't want to work for 25 minutes straight?
well, these intervals weren't chosen arbitrarily, and there's a point behind them. one full cycle of the pomodoro method makes sure that you work for twice as long as you rest:

4 periods of work × 25 minute work periods = 100 minutes of work

4 periods of break × 5 minute break periods = 20 minutes of break + 30 minute long break = 50 minutes of break

staying at the numbers of 25, 5, and 30 keeps the ratio right. however, if you really want to, you can change the numbers with the handy dandy settings section!

## cool, thanks!
yeah of course! again, here's the [link](https://nicholasiguess.github.io/hackmato/)!
